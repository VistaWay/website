<p style="text-indent: 50px">Hello fellow Vista Way Alumni! This page is dedicated to the past residents of Vista Way. Here is 
    where many of us found our first home away from home in a place where dreams come true- and for many of us they did!
    What better place than Walt Disney World, in sunny tropical Orlando, with
    thousands of other college aged men and women from around the country and world? 
    Many stories and once in a lifetime memories and friendships were formed here and many of them still last to this day. Even if years have gone 
    past and we've lost touch with one another, the experiences we had here together are something that will last a lifetime.
</p>
   
<p>***If you did not know, Vista Way, as well as the other CP housing complexes were sold 
in 2022 and all college program students live at a complex called Flamingo Crossings now. This page was created
in 2024 as a tribute to a place of the past- Vista Way will live on in 
our memories forever now <3 </p>
<br>
